# SHA-256 Memory Setup

*Abstract*

SHA, or Secure Hash Algorithm, is part of a large family of cryptographic hash
functions. This hash function acts as a unique identification for pieces of data. No two
pieces of data will share the same hash. Hashing acts as a one way function, in that once
the data is encrypted, it cannot be returned to the original format. Such characteristics
allow these algorithms to be useful in many scenarios including but not limited to
authentication, password validation, and anti-tamper mechanisms.
There have been many iteration of the SHA algorithms. The scope of this project
revolves around the SHA-2 family, more specifically SHA-256. SHA-256 has a wide
variety of applications. Because it outputs data in 256 bit chunks, it is used in Debian
package authentication, cryptocurrency transaction validation, and many standardized
U.S. Government applications. The SHA-2 family is becoming a bit out-of-date, in that
with each passing year, it becomes more prone to data length attacks, and in the next few
years, the next family, SHA-3, will be adopted as the new standard.
