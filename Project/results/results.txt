ECE 464 Project Results

- Cell Area
	Area = 4950.2601nm squared
 
- Simulated with 'hello' message
- Cycles for secret file = (Total Simulation Time) / (Clock Period in TB)
	# of Cycles = (585ns - 315ns) / 10 = 27 clock cycles


- Clock Period from setup.tcl
	Clock Period = 10

- Performance = (Area) * (# of Cycles) * (Clock Period)
	Performance = 4950.2601 * 27 * 10 = 1336570.227
